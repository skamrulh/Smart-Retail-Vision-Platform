AI-Powered Smart Retail Vision Platform
Overview

The AI-Powered Smart Retail Vision Platform is a production-grade machine learning system designed to analyze in-store customer behavior, optimize shelf inventory, and generate actionable business insights in real time using computer vision, OCR, and transformer-based language models.

The platform ingests live camera feeds, processes them through scalable ML pipelines, and delivers structured analytics and natural-language insights to retail operators—enabling smarter merchandising, faster restocking, and data-driven store optimization.
